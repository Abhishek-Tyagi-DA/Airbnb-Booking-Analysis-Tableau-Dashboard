Project Description
In this challenge, I leveraged a dataset which I previously analyzed during an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project in Python.The task was designing an interactive and informative Tableau Dashboard using the dataset that was used during EDA.
In this dashboard, I've analyzed data focusing on customers who haven't cancelled bookings and whose country is known. I've used this data to answer business questions and draw insights.


For this Purpose, I utilised the Tableau Pane for the data wrangling and Tableau Public for the Dashboard creation.This Project helped me get the working knowledge of Power BI and helped me with get acquainted with the challenges involbved in handling the real-world large datasets and how to tackle those problems. Through this Project I Showed my problem solving skills.
